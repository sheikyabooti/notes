CPU Architecture/Family
------------------------
The two main vendors of desktop processors (x86_64) are Intel and AMD.  For the sake of simplicity, we will only look at Intel processors.

Intel splits their lineup into market segments, which helps guide CPU selection.  For desktops, from least performant to most

Celeron < i3 < i5 < i7 < i9 < Xeon  

Celeron, i3, and i5 are all used in cost conscious designs, and typically have either lower clockspeed, lower cache memory, or lower memory bandwidth than i7 or i9.  Xeon is typically marketed at server applications, and tends to have very large cache memory and/or high cpu clock, along with correspondingly high price tags.  In searching for a desktop, I will focus on i7 and i9, having good cost/performance.

Selecting your CPU also locks in your chipset and architecture.  Other than the chipset, the main caveat in selecting an i7/i9 is making sure you are looking at current generation architecture.  Intel releases products on a "tick-tock" cadence, which usually means there are two generations of mainline processors available at a given time.  Currently these are Comet Lake and Cascade Lake.

Both of these processors use the LGA 1200 chipset.  This will guide the choice of motherboard, memory, and storage

CPU Processor Selection
------------------------
after narrowing the choice to i7/i9, we are confronted with the strange naming convention of Intel microprocessors.

K           Frequency unlocked, integrated GPU enabled
KA          Avenger's themed version of the K processor
KF          Frequncey unlocked, integrated GPU disabled

for now, I will be looking at K and potentially KF or KA processors


Motherboard
-------------------------
LGA 1200 is a microprocessor and chipset, manufactured by Intel.  It is compatible with the Comet Lake and Cascade Lake architecture.  

chipsets
There are a number of chipsets that are compatible with LGA 1200.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA_1200

roughly from least peforming to best performing
H110 < B460 < H470 < Q470 < W480 < Z490 

Intel Z90 chipset $50

https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-briefs/z490-chipset-brief.pdf

Motherboards vary widely in terms of features.  
Things to expect to find on a motherboard
Gigabit ethernet
USB 2.0 and 3.0
Serial ATA
fan headers

Things to look for on a motherboard
WiFi 802.11ax
Bluetooth
USB-C connection
2 m.2 connectors - these are used for the Storage

Questions to ask
Are there any special connection types I need?  Firewire?
